Universally recognized for its soft touch, unparalleled comfort on the skin, and hypoallergenic properties, it allows the body to breathe, preventing the buildup of sweat and odors. It is an extremely versatile fabric, which can have matte or slightly satiny finishes depending on the weave. Ideal for daily use, from basic T-shirts to luxurious bedding, offering freshness and durability." },

No ironing needed. Dries fast.", suited: ["Flowy Dresses", "Jumpsuits", "Blouses", "Sets"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"], desc: "Duna Crepe has revolutionized contemporary casual fashion with its absolute practicality. It is a polyester fabric with a characteristic slightly crinkled texture, resembling small 'popcorn', which gives it a modern look and completely eliminates the need for ironing. Its drape is fluid and just heavy enough, not clinging to the body and being perfect for travel, as it comes out of the suitcase ready to wear. Ideally chosen for pieces that require movement, such as circle skirts and maxi dresses." },

Dry flat. Iron at medium heat.", suited: ["T-Shirts", "Casual Dresses", "Pajamas", "Light Leggings"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"], desc: "Viscolycra is the perfect marriage between viscose fiber and elastane yarn, resulting in a knit with an incredibly soft, cool, and fluid touch. Unlike cotton, it has a 'heavier' drape that follows the body's curves elegantly without tightening. It is widely used in casual 'comfy' pieces, such as loose blouses and summer dresses, allowing total freedom of movement. Its high elasticity ensures extreme comfort but requires care in washing not to stretch excessively." },

Dry in shade to maintain elasticity.", suited: ["Tank Tops", "Bodycon Dresses", "Collars", "Light Cardigans"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter"], desc: "Ribbed Knit fabric is easily identified by its raised vertical or horizontal stripes (ribs), created by a specific knit structure called Ribbing. This construction gives the fabric very high natural elasticity, making it fit the body perfectly (bodycon effect). It is a classic that never goes out of style, used both in finishes for collars and cuffs and in whole pieces like sheath dresses and tank tops, providing a textured and modern look." },

Shrinks on first wash. Iron at low heat.", suited: ["Flowy Dresses", "Button-down Shirts", "Flowing Skirts", "Scarves"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"], desc: "Historically known as 'Artificial Silk' or Rayon, Viscose is produced from wood cellulose. It offers the fluid drape, cool touch, and moisture absorption of a natural fiber, but with a vibrant color intensity typically synthetic. It is famous for its impeccable drape on dresses and full skirts, swaying with movement. Its characteristic of wrinkling easily gives the pieces a natural and relaxed air. Note: it usually shrinks in the first wash, so many garments are pre-washed." },

Do not iron (heat can flatten the effect).", suited: ["Bikinis", "Summer Dresses", "Blouses", "Kids Wear"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"], desc: "Seersucker (Anarruga) is a fabric with a strong visual identity, marked by a characteristic crinkled or puckered effect that alternates smooth and gathered bands. This texture is not just aesthetic; it creates air channels that make the fabric fresher and prevent it from sticking to the skin on hot days. Its biggest advantage is practicality: it should not be ironed, as heat would flatten its charming texture. It is a historical favorite in beachwear (bikinis and swimsuits) and children's clothing for being light, durable, and requiring no complex care." },
    { id: 7, name: "Airflow Crepe", tagline: "Aerated Touch", cat: "sinteticos", label: "Synthetics", orig: "Asia", fiber: "Polyester", weave: "Crepe", finish: "Aerated/Dotted", accords: { color: 90, softness: 70, warmth: 40, maintenance: 10, lustre: 35 }, specs: { weight: "140-190 g/m²", thickness: "Medium", transparency: "Opaque", stretch: "Low" }, care: "Simple wash. Fast drying. Wrinkle-free.", suited: ["Modern Dress Shirts", "Light Blazers", "Wide Leg Pants", "Dresses"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer", "Autumn"], desc: "Airflow Crepe gets its name due to its weaving technology that creates a microporous texture, giving it an 'aerated' touch and visually dotted look. Very similar to Duna Crepe, it differs by having a slightly heavier drape and a more sophisticated and less rustic look. It is opaque, does not wrinkle, and has excellent color durability, making it perfect for workwear that needs to maintain elegance throughout the day, such as modern dress shirts and pants." },

Warm iron if needed.", suited: ["Delicate Blouses", "Light Party Dresses", "Pleated Skirts"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"], desc: "The name 'Nuage' means 'cloud' in French, which perfectly describes the touch of this fabric: extremely soft, light, and velvety, resembling the texture of peach skin or washed silk. Unlike more rustic crepes, Nuage has a smooth surface with a very discreet and elegant satin sheen. Its drape is fluid and noble, being ideal for pieces that require delicacy and sophistication, such as bow blouses and daytime party dresses. It is a fabric that conveys femininity and refinement." },

Iron with care.", suited: ["Structured Blazers", "Tailored Pants", "Shift Dresses", "Pencil Skirts"], seasons: ["Autumn", "Winter", "Spring"], desc: "Known in the market as Barbie or Prada fabric, it is the star of modern tailoring. It is a full-bodied fabric, with a heavy and structured drape that shapes the body without marking imperfections (like cellulite). The addition of elastane (Spandex) is its big secret, providing comfort that traditional tailoring fabrics do not have, allowing greater mobility. It has a noble, matte, and smooth appearance, being the number one choice for blazers, women's suits, and pants that need to convey power and professionalism." },

Dry fast. High durability. Does not shrink.", suited: ["Uniforms", "Tablecloths", "Aprons", "Curtains", "Decoration"], seasons: ["All Year"], desc: "Oxford is the 'workhorse' of synthetic fabrics. Characterized by its 'basketweave' weave (yarns interlaced in pairs), it is extremely resistant to tearing, holes, and fading. Its 100% polyester version has a more rustic and dry feel, being unbeatable in terms of durability and cost-benefit. Because it does not wrinkle easily and dries very quickly, it is the industrial standard for school and professional uniforms, besides being widely used in decoration (tablecloths, napkins, curtains) for its ease of maintenance." },
    { id: 11, name: "Oxfordine", tagline: "Practical Shirting", cat: "planos", label: "Woven Fabrics", orig: "Global", fiber: "Polyester/Cotton", weave: "Plain", finish: "Smooth and Light", accords: { color: 85, softness: 60, warmth: 45, maintenance: 20, lustre: 35 }, specs: { weight: "110-140 g/m²", thickness: "Thin", transparency: "Slight", stretch: "None" }, care: "Easy wash and iron.", suited: ["Dress Shirts", "Medical Lab Coats", "Light Uniforms", "Sheets"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"], desc: "Oxfordine can be seen as the 'more elegant brother' of Oxford. It maintains the practicality and resistance of polyester but is constructed with finer yarns and a tighter weave, resulting in a much lighter fabric, with a smoother touch and better drape. It is opaque enough for shirting but fresh enough for summer. It is widely adopted in the manufacture of medical lab coats and everyday dress shirts, as it wrinkles much less than pure cotton and keeps an impeccable appearance for longer." },

Iron at medium heat.", suited: ["Suits", "Dress Pants", "Skirts", "Overcoats"], seasons: ["Autumn", "Winter", "Spring"], desc: "Gabardine is synonymous with elegance and durability in tailoring. Its tightly woven diagonal twill weave gives the fabric a smooth surface, a discreet shine, and a firm structure that holds perfect creases in dress pants. It is a fabric resistant to abrasion and, in some versions, water-repellent. Ideal for those looking for aligned pieces, such as suits, blazers, and straight-cut pants, which transition well from the office to social events. Its density makes it great for mid-season and light winter." },

It is the basis of high-quality men's and women's shirting. In addition to clothing, Tricoline is the darling of crafts and patchwork, as it is easy to cut, sew, and exists in an infinite number of vibrant digital prints. Being 100% cotton, it is hypoallergenic and thermal, perfect for children's clothing and pieces that stay in direct contact with the skin." },

By mixing the noble linen fiber with viscose or polyester, a fabric is obtained that maintains the rustic, elegant, and fresh aesthetic of linen but with a much softer touch and less tendency to crumple. The drape also benefits, gaining more fluidity. It is the perfect choice for those who want the natural sophistication of linen in pieces that need to withstand a whole day of use without looking sloppy." },

Shrinks on wash (buy extra margin). Steam iron.", suited: ["Maxi Dresses", "Wrap Skirts", "Summer Sets", "Jumpsuits"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"], desc: "Viscose Linen Look (Viscolinho) is a huge success: a fabric made of 100% viscose but worked with irregular yarns (slub) to mimic the visual texture of linen. The result is a fabric with the heavy and fluid drape of viscose, extreme softness and freshness, but with that rustic chic look so desired in summer. It is much cheaper than linen and does not prickle the skin. Ideal for ample and flowing pieces, such as maxi skirts and slip dresses. Redoubled attention to shrinkage in the first wash." },

Iron with care.", suited: ["Beach Cover-ups", "Summer Shirts", "Baby Clothes", "Tunics"], seasons: ["Summer"], desc: "Cambric is the definition of delicacy. An extremely fine, light fabric with a subtle and elegant transparency. When made of cotton or linen, it has an unparalleled dry and fresh touch, being perfect for torrid climates. It is widely used in making baby clothes (like batiste linen) for being soft and not irritating the skin, and in women's fashion in luxurious beach cover-ups and 'oversized' shirts that protect from the sun without heating. It may require the use of a top or lining due to transparency." },

Careful ironing over embroidery.", suited: ["Romantic Dresses", "Off-shoulder Blouses", "Full Skirts", "Kids Wear"], seasons: ["Spring", "Summer"], desc: "Eyelet (Laise) is a cotton fabric characterized by its openwork embroidery that forms floral or geometric designs. It is a fabric that breathes romance and femininity, referring to a vintage and artisanal style. Being all perforated, it is extremely ventilated and fresh. In most pieces (like dresses and skirts), it requires a lining to cover the transparency of the holes, but on sleeves and details, the cutouts remain apparent on the skin, creating a beautiful visual effect. It is an indispensable classic in the summer wardrobe." },

Durable. Can fade over time (stonewashed effect).", suited: ["Colored Pants (Chinos)", "Jackets", "Shorts", "Utility Skirts"], seasons: ["All Year"], desc: "Twill is the 'mother' of Jeans. Technically, the weave is the same (diagonal lines), but while jeans are dyed indigo, twill is dyed in various solid colors (beige, black, military green, etc.). It is a full-bodied, resistant, and very comfortable fabric, especially in modern versions that mix cotton with a little elastane. It is the perfect base for casual pants (Chino or Cargo type), light jackets, and shorts that need to withstand daily use, offering a neater option than traditional denim." },

Bleach possible on white version.", suited: ["Heavy Jackets", "Work Pants", "Bags and Backpacks", "Operational Uniforms"], seasons: ["Autumn", "Winter"], desc: "Drill is often confused with twill or denim, but distinguished by its higher weight and stiffness. It is a fabric made to withstand impact. Thick, strong, and without elasticity, it is the definitive choice for heavy work clothes (PPE), industrial uniforms, and also for accessories like bags, backpacks, and caps that need structure. In fashion, drill is used in structured jackets and wide-leg pants that maintain the volume and architectural shape of the piece." },

Unlike cheap polyester, Supplex has a soft touch very close to cotton but does not absorb sweat, transporting it out of the fabric (fast drying). It offers excellent muscle compression, support, and does not become transparent when stretched (if of good weight). It is extremely durable, does not pill easily, and keeps colors vivid for years." },

There are variations: 'Helanca Light' is thin, cool, and predominantly used as a lining for transparent dresses and skirts. 'School Helanca' is thicker, warmer, and fuzzy on the inside, being the national standard for school uniform pants due to its resistance to frequent kneeling and washing. It does not wrinkle, does not fade easily, and dries in minutes, being extremely practical for intense daily life." },
